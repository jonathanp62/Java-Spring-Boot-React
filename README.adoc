Spring-Boot-React
-----------------

A program that demonstrates setting up a Spring Boot REST application that also uses React.

Directory Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The Java server application is in the server directory. The Gradle build file defines the locations of the source files and resources.
* The React client application is in the client directory.

Creating the React Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Run 'npx create-react-app client' from the application root directory.
* Run 'npm install react-router-dom' from the client directory.
* Please see the spring-boot application in $HOME/React-Projects as this application will be created with Vite but still use the Java Spring Boot React application's REST API endpoints.
